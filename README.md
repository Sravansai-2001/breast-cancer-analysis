# Breast Cancer Clinical Data Analysis

This Power BI project explores a comprehensive breast cancer dataset containing clinical, molecular, genomic, and demographic information of over 1,000 patients. The analysis uncovers patterns related to diagnosis, treatment efficacy, survival outcomes, and biomarker relationships.

## Objectives

- Identify age-specific prevalence across breast cancer subtypes.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of treatment types (surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiotherapy).
- Analyze correlations between tumor characteristics and survival outcomes.
- Investigate biomarker impacts (ER, PR, HER2) on treatment and prognosis.
- Discover genomic and cohort-specific patterns affecting relapse-free intervals.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard development
- **Excel** – Data preprocessing and cleaning
- **Microsoft Word** – Report documentation

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Slicers for surgery type, cancer subtype, and hormone/chemo status.
- **Visualizations**: Card visuals, pie charts, bar graphs, tornado charts, and stacked bar charts.
- **Survival Analysis**: Explore survival trends based on treatment type, stage, and biomarkers.
- **Subtype Exploration**: Detailed slicers to focus on ER/PR/HER2 statuses and PAM50 subtypes.
- **Relapse-Free Intervals**: Understand treatment influence on recurrence timing.

## Insights & Findings

- ER-positive patients had improved survival with hormone therapy.
- Surgery type was significantly associated with tumor stage but not always with better outcomes.
- Radiotherapy extended relapse-free intervals in HER2+ and advanced-stage patients.
- Mutation count and subtype classifications correlated with prognosis and survival.
- Distinct cellularity levels were linked to different surgical preferences.
